# How to Ask Questions

## Genius Bar
The instructors will be offering support each day during `Genius Bar`. The schedule is outlined here: [schedule](./schedule.md) and on the WDI8 Calendar as well [calendar](http://ga-dc.github.io/wdi8/calendar.html)

Students will be limited to `5 minutes` at a time with one-on-one instructor support during `Genius Bar`. We are doing this to ensure we can support ALL students during a session as well giving you an opportunity to try working through your problem. You may have additional time with instructors during a session after an attempt solve your problem. 

## TLDR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

The instructors will be using Github issues on the `project2` repository as the primary forum for answering technical questions as well as offering support during `Genius Bar`

Issues should follow this format:
```
I tried ___.
I expected ___ to happen.
___ happened instead.
My repo link is ___ and my question is about lines ___.
```

*Please close your issues when you've received a satisfactory answer*, and let us know what the solution was! We'll close issues that have gone more than 3 hours without any updates.

**Note:** Issues can only be reopened by instructors. Therefore, should your issue get closed, please create a *new* issue, and if it's applicable to your previous issue, just include a link to the previous issue.

## Why?
Many reasons! The biggest is that programmers often have the same question. This way, students with the same question can find their answer in one place.

Additionally, having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Sometimes, simply articulating the question gives you the answer!

## How?
Below is a guide for the information that must be included when submitting an issue. (You can also use the handy [template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/project2/issues/new?title=issue+with+____&body=I+tried+_____.+I+expected+_____+to+happen._____+happened+instead.%0DMy+repo+link+is+___+and+my+question+is+about+lines+___.) above.) It is expected that you will try to debug/solve an issue prior to submitting a request for help on Github.

#### Context
When submitting an issue, please provide some context as to what the problem is. This includes but is not limited to:
- What User Story you are currently working on
- What you are trying to do (in terms of code)
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors (and screenshots if applicable)
- Gems and/or other technologies being used (if applicable)

#### Approaches Tried
Give information about what you have done to solve the problem. Including but not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem

## Can students respond to other students' issues?
**YES!**

## So, when *should* I seek out an instructor in-person?
First, **we really want you talk to us when it's an emotional issue** more than a technical one.

For technical problems, seek us out in person when you've submitted an issue, and have spent more than 15 minutes trying to solve the problem yourself, 15 minutes Googling, and 15 minutes asking other students for help (in-person, on Slack, etc).
